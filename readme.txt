All Site Search provides you with the best and most relevant search for your Site. It is the first full-search solution and 100% safe because of off-site indexing.

== Description ==

All Site Search provides you with the best and most relevant search for your Site. It is the first full-search solution, enabling your visitors to search for pages, documents, images, videos, sound files, zip files and more. As all other rich search features, this is of course customizable.

All Site Search is an off-site indexing service and has therefore no control at all over your site. This removes your worries for viruses and junk code that sometimes comes with on-site indexing solutions.

Easy to set up and you register your site for indexing with a few mouse clicks. Easy to customize, you style the search results the way you want them.

= All-Content Search (TM) =

With All Site Search your visitors can, for the first time, really find the required information on your Site. This includes Pages, Documents, Images, Sound, Video, Zipped files, Software and Email addresses. (You can of course customize what can be searched for.)

= Easy and Hassle Free =

All Site Search is extremely easy to set up. After you have installed the plugin, you use it to register your site for indexing and customize the search options.

= 100% Safe =

If you were to install an on-site indexing service, it would probably change your page content, database and web server settings. With All Site Search you are 100% safe because it is an off-site indexing service. It has no control over your site. The search is also off-site and will not put any load on your system at all.
 
= The Most Relevance =

All Site Search executes six ranking algorithms in parallel. The algorithms uses the index together with hundreds of ranking parameters to ensure the very most relevance for every search made.
